# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Creating an attractive dark theme with a matching primary color can help your LinkedIn profile stand out and make a strong visual impact. Here's a color scheme suggestion that combines a dark theme with an appealing primary color:

1. **Dark Background Color:** #121212 (This is a deep, dark gray color that serves as the background for your profile.)

2. **Primary Color:** #FF6C00 (This is a vibrant orange color that will act as your primary accent color.)

With this color scheme, the dark background provides a sleek and sophisticated appearance, while the bold orange primary color adds a touch of energy and enthusiasm to your profile. You can use the primary color for headings, buttons, and other elements you want to emphasize.

Additionally, you can use neutral colors for text and secondary elements to complement the dark theme and primary color. For example:

3. **Text Color:** #EDEDED (This is a light gray color for text to ensure readability against the dark background.)

4. **Secondary Color:** #707070 (This is a mid-gray color that can be used for secondary elements like dividers or icons.)

Remember, consistency is key when designing your LinkedIn profile. Try to apply this color scheme across your profile picture, cover photo, and other visuals to maintain a cohesive and professional look.

Before finalizing the color scheme, it's a good idea to preview how it will appear on your LinkedIn profile. Make sure the colors complement each other and create a pleasant visual experience for viewers.

Using a carefully selected color scheme can help make your LinkedIn profile more visually appealing and memorable, increasing your chances of making a positive impression on potential employers or connections. Good luck with your profile!
